Documentation
-------------

``rios_preprocessor`` is meant as a replacement for the ArcGIS python
code that currently produces the inputs for the main RIOS program.

``rios_preprocessor`` produces rasters of:

-  Downslope retention index
-  Upslope source
-  Riparian index
-  Slope index

that are used as input for the following RIOS objectives:

-  Erosion Control
-  Nitrogen Retention
-  Phosphorus
-  Flood Mitigation
-  Groundwater Recharge/Baseflow

Along the way, there are some additional tricks ``rios_preprocessor``
uses that may be useful in other contexts:

-  rasterizes an input shapefile river network and matches it to a
   (raster) DEM/DTM
-  identifies discontinuous river banks along a rasterized river
-  identifies the end points of rasterized rivers
